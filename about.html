        <p>
            I am an upcoming sophomore undergraduate electrical engineering (switching to computer science) student at the University of California, Irvine. I am
            open to potential internships and research opportunities to get hands-on experience in the field of information and technology. As of current, I am
            in the process of developing a discord bot that uses a REST API to track current and upcoming livestreams of Virtual YouTubers that belong to the
            Cover Corp agency (Hololive, HOLOSTARS, etc).
